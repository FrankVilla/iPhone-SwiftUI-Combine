##The Movie Database API

This project utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data. TMDb is a free and community-driven movie and TV show database with over 20 million registered users.

To use TMDb API in your own project, you will need to create an account and request an API key. Once you have your API key, you can use it to make requests to the API endpoints.

This project demonstrates how to use TMDb API with SwiftUI and Combine to fetch and display movie data. For more information on how to use TMDb API, please refer to their documentation.
